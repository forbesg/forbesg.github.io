The frustrations grew as the site,\nalthough functional, was far from easy on the eye. In addition to this, at a time\nwhen mobile and tablet browser use were on the rise, the site was a calamity.</p>\n<p>I started to learn <em>HTML</em> and <em>CSS</em> and proceeded to create my first static site.</p>\n<p>Over the last couple of years I have implemented <em>Twitter Bootstrap</em>, some <em>PHP</em>\nincludes for ease of management / maintenance, as well as a little <em>AJAX</em> for\nrequesting additional content while keeping the initial page size low and\nrequesting content from my (shamefully out-of-date) Blogger Site.</p>\n<p>The most recent version of the site was written using a static site generator called\n<a href=\"https://metalsmith.io/\" rel=\"noopener\">Metalsmith</a> allowing me to\ncreate dynamically generated website pages and use build tools such as SCSS,\nwhilst getting the speed and security benefits of a static website.</p>\n<p>I removed Bootstrap and wrote all the css using flexbox to create a responsive\nlayout which reduced the size of the resources required on page load in my\nsearch for fast load times.</p>\n<p>I also took a step onto Progressive Web Apps (PWA) which enabled even faster page load\ntimes as well as the ability to work offline (probably a little over the top for a\nsite like this but good to try out).</p>\n","image":"/images/projects/web/fnbg.jpg","imageAlt":"FNBG Ltd - Telecoms Business Website","features":["html","css","php","javascript","bootstrap","responsive design","ajax","scss","flexbox","metalsmith","progressive web app"],"carousel":[],"url":"https://fnbg.co.uk","repo":"","path":"/portfolio/website/fnbg-ltd/"}},"context":{}}
