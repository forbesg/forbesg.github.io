As I progressed with the rebuild\nI was learning <em>html</em> and <em>css</em> as I went along, but after little time the website\nwas looking much more like a business website should.</p>\n<p>At the same time, mobile devices were really becoming more of a consideration,\nand I spent more of my time getting to grips with <em>media queries</em>. Although the\nthird generation mobile friendly version of the site was working well, I was very\naware that older browsers and some of the mobile browsers were not supporting many\nof the <em>CSS3</em> features that I was implementing.</p>\n<p>In addition to this I had starting picking up some <em>PHP</em> and was discovering the\nlack of <em>DRY</em> in my workflow. The site was loosely transferred to <em>PHP</em> and I was\nable include common parts of the site (head, header &#x26; footer) to simplify\nthe process of making any further changes.</p>\n<p>The fourth, and current, version of the site introduced <em>Bootstrap</em> and immediately\nI found a lot of my headaches went away. The ability to work responsively out of\nthe box was a big plus and although there was a fair bit of work 'tweaking' it,\nthe end result was much more resilient.</p>\n","image":"/images/projects/web/BeautyEdinburgh.jpg","imageAlt":"Beauty Edinburgh - Beauty Salon PHP Website","features":["html","css","php","javascript","bootstrap","online booking","responsive design"],"url":"https://www.beautyedinburgh.co.uk","repo":"","path":"/portfolio/website/beauty-edinburgh/"}},"context":{}}
