As scores were entered, the tables would update the teams respective\nplayed, point and goal difference figures and sort the table accordingly.</p>\n<p>At the end of each stage, the qualifying teams would progress to the next round.</p>\n<p>The application also automatically generated the days fixture list based upon the\ndate the user was visiting the page.</p>\n<p>I also integrated Google Maps to view all the Stadia used for the competition.
