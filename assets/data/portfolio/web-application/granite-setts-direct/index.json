Traditional\ne-commerce platforms felt slow and cumbersome to navigate so the aim was to create a\nfast and straight forward and uncluttered user experience.</p>\n<p>After our initial discussions with the client we agreed that we would use Vue to create\nthe UI and the <a href=\"https://nuxtjs.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Nuxt JS</a> framework to take advantage of server-side rendering. In order to\nintegrate the e-commerce functionality without the weight of a full blown E-Commerce\nframework, we integrated the <a href=\"https://moltin.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Moltin</a> headless E-Commerce API which made the overall site very\nlight-weight, fast and responsive. This also allowed us to take full control of the\nflow of the buying process.</p>\n<p>To design the site I worked closely with the client to create a clean, uncomplicated\nvisual experience to allow to customer to focus on the product itself.</p>\n","image":"/images/projects/web-application/granite-setts-direct.jpg","imageAlt":"Granite Setts Direct - Headless Ecommerce Website","features":["HTML5","SCSS","Vue JS","Nuxt JS","Moltin","Babel","Webpack","Ecommerce"],"carousel":[],"url":"https://www.granitesettsdirect.co.uk","repo":"","path":"/portfolio/web-application/granite-setts-direct/"}},"context":{}}
