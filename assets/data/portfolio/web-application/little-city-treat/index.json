The company\nallows self-employed Beauty Professionals to set their own availability whose\navailability then feeds into the online booking system for the customers to book.</p>\n<p>The project had three individual aspects; the client facing website with integrated\nbooking system and payment gateway, an application for the Beauty Professionals to\nmanage their availability, calendar and earnings, and the administrator\napplication to allow overall management of all aspects of the system.</p>\n<p>There are a lot of third party online booking systems available however all of them were a\nlittle too rigid for our requirements and tend to feel as though they have been\nshoehorned into a site.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/projects/web-application/booking-mobile.png\" alt=\"Mobile Booking Application\"></p>\n<p>It was important that the booking process be easy to use, fast and secure. After\nmuch consultation the process was finalised allowing customers to select their desired\ntreatments and choose by either date or therapist before confirming the booking and\ncompleting payment. Payment is made directly to the Service Provider through Stripe,\nand an application fee is taken for the booking.</p>\n<p>There is also an e-commerce aspect of the site, initially to sell Gift Cards to be used in the\nbooking system, but can easily be expanded to sell additional products if required.</p>\n<p>The entire application is written as a static site using the Nuxt JS framework. Business\nlogic is handled using serverless functions meaning that costs were kept low and\nthe other required applications could be seemlessly integrated into the system.</p>\n<p>Progressive Web App implementation means that users can get an native app experience\nwhen using the booking system including notifications.</p>\n<p>Little City Treat Edinburgh launched in Edinburgh at the start of 2020 and has\nnow expanded to Newcastle.</p>\n<p>You can view the site and booking system at the following links - <a href=\"https://www.littlecitytreat.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Little City Treat Beauty Website</a> and <a href=\"https://book.littlecitytreat.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Beauty Booking System</a></p>\n","image":"/images/projects/web-application/little-city-treat.jpg","imageAlt":"Little City Treat - Booking System Web Application","features":["HTML5","SCSS","Vue JS","Nuxt JS","DatoCMS","Firebase","Babel","Webpack","Progressive Web App","Stripe","ECommerce"],"carousel":[],"url":"https://www.littlecitytreat.com","repo":"","path":"/portfolio/web-application/little-city-treat/"}},"context":{}}
