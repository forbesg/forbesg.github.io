The company allows self-employed Beauty Professionals\nto set their own availability and populate the booking system based upon those therapists.</p>\n<p>The project had three individual aspects; the client facing website with integrated\nbooking system, an application for the Beauty Professionals to enable them to\nmanage their availability, calendar and earnings, and the administrator\napplication to allow overall management of all aspects of the system.</p>\n<p>There are a lot of third party booking systems available however all of them were a\nlittle too rigid for our requirements and tend to feel as though they have been\nshoehorned into a site.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/projects/web-application/booking-mobile.png\" alt=\"Mobile Booking Application\"></p>\n<p>It was important that the booking process be easy to use, fast and secure. After\nmuch consultation the process was finalised allowing customers to select their desired\ntreatments and choose by either date or therapist before confirming the booking and\ncompleting payment.</p>\n<p>There is also an e-commerce aspect of the site, initially to sell Gift Cards to be used in the\nbooking system, but can easily be expanded to sell additional products if required.</p>\n<p>The entire application is written as a static site using the Nuxt JS framework. Business\nlogic is handled using serverless functions meaning that costs were kept low and\nthe other required applications could be seemlessly integrated into the system.</p>\n<p>Progressive Web App implementation means that users can get an native app experience\nincluding notifications.</p>\n<p>Little City Treat Edinburgh is launching at the beginning of 2020.</p>\n","image":"/images/projects/web-application/little-city-treat.jpg","features":["HTML5","SCSS","Vue JS","Nuxt JS","Firebase","Babel","Webpack","Progressive Web App"],"url":"https://www.littlecitytreat.com","path":"/portfolio/web-application/little-city-treat/"}},"context":{}}
