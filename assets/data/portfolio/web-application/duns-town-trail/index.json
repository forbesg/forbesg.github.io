From a user\nfriendly web-based GUI, the client is able to update the content of the app and\nalso add additional points of interest in the future.</p>\n<p>Map interactivity within the app is provided using the MapBox JavaScript SDK,\nand by obtaining the users location can display which points of interest are\naround them and access information about them directly from the map.</p>\n","image":"/images/projects/web-application/duns-town-trail.jpg","imageAlt":"Duns Town Trail - Progressive Web App","features":["HTML","SCSS","Vue JS","Gridsome","DatoCMS","Progressive Web App"],"carousel":[{"src":"/images/projects/web-application/town-trail/trail-view.png","alt":"Town Trail"},{"src":"/images/projects/web-application/town-trail/trail-map.png","alt":"Town Trail Map View"},{"src":"/images/projects/web-application/town-trail/wojtek-trail-view.png","alt":"Wojtek Trail View"}],"url":"https://town-trail.netlify.app/","repo":"","path":"/portfolio/web-application/duns-town-trail/"}},"context":{}}
