The test would return a percentage\nof how much two people loved each other.</p>\n<p>The method is simple. Take the\nnames of the two people and count the instances of each letter in the word \"LOVES\".\nWhen the count is complete you would be left with 5 numbers.</p>\n<pre><code>Tom \"LOVES\" Nicole\n1, 2, 0, 1, 0\n</code></pre>\n<p>The next step in the process is to add each of the adjacent numbers together\nwhich would then result in 4 numbers.</p>\n<pre><code>'1 + 2', '2 + 0', '0 + 1', '1 + 0'\n3, 2, 1, 1\n</code></pre>\n<p>This step would then be repeated until there were only two numbers remaining. At this\npoint you would just join the two numbers together and that was your percentage.</p>\n<pre><code>5, 3, 2\n8, 5\n85%\n</code></pre>\n<p>This proved to be a good test and when it was complete I created a BlackBerry\nWebWorks Application using the algorithm.</p>\n","image":"/images/projects/blackberry/love-is.jpg","imageAlt":"The Love Calculator - Blackberry Application","features":["html5","css3","javascript","bbui.js","blackberry webworks"],"carousel":[],"url":"https://appworld.blackberry.com/webstore/content/43684889/","repo":"","path":"/portfolio/blackberry/love-is/"}},"context":{}}
