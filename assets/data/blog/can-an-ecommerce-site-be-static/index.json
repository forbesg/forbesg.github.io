More recently these have been joined by the likes of\nBigCommerce, Squarespace &#x26; Wix, all of which provide a quick and easy way of starting\nto sell online.</p>\n<p>What all of the aforementioned e-commerce platforms have in common is that they are\ntightly coupled with the storefront that the customer sees. Both website and admin\nbackend are running together on the same server and it is that server which creates\nthe e-commerce website. In addition to this, there are limitations in terms of\ndeveloping the site exactly as you want it. The design of the site is constrained\nby the platform itself, and the more flexible a platform is in the design options,\nthe more expensive it becomes to develop.</p>\n<h2 id=\"headless-ecommerce\"><a href=\"#headless-ecommerce\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Headless Ecommerce</h2>\n<p>A more recent addition to the e-commerce space has been the headless e-commerce\nframework. Headless simply refers to the fact that the framework itself doesn't\nhave a storefront, it simply implements the e-commerce backend functionality whilst\nleaving you free to create, design and customise your online shop using any\ntechnology you like. The website (or App...or both) then makes API calls to the e-commerce backend\nto display to the user and facilitate the sales.</p>\n<p>The headless e-commerce space has become very busy very quickly with frameworks\nlike Elasticpath, Vendure and Open Source Sylius whilst the likes of Magento, BigCommerce\nand Shopify have created Headless versions of their frameworks.</p>\n<h3 id=\"omnichannel-sales\"><a href=\"#omnichannel-sales\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Omnichannel Sales</h3>\n<p>Using a headless e-commerce architecture opens up a wide variety of additional\nsales channels and routes to market. A headless e-commerce solution can not only\nallow sales through a website but also provides e-commerce functionality to\nMobile Apps, IoT devices and in-person Point of Sale devices.</p>\n<h3 id=\"design-flexibility\"><a href=\"#design-flexibility\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Design Flexibility</h3>\n<p>With this level of decoupling of the front and backend of an e-commerce framework,\nyou achieve total freedom to create a unique and fast shopping experience for the user and\na faster time to market. It also allows you to easily change your storefront website\nin the future, whether that be design or underlying technology, without touching\nany of the e-commerce backend code.</p>\n<p>Many large multi-national businesses' have embraced this new architecture\nto improve their customer's shopping experience, including Nike, Under Armour,\nTarget &#x26; Debenhams.</p>\n<h2 id=\"taking-headless-ecommerce-static\"><a href=\"#taking-headless-ecommerce-static\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Taking Headless Ecommerce Static</h2>\n<p>Due to the nature of modern static site generators and website build tools,\nheadless e-commerce can fit perfectly into this architecture. Communication is\nmade to the headless API during the build process and creates a static website\nthat can be hosted on any server at a minimal cost.</p>\n<p>Realtime interactions with the backend, such as authentication, inventory\nqueries and sales, can be handled using API requests whilst the user interacts\nwith the site.</p>\n<p>For those on an ultra-low budget, products like Snipcart enable e-commerce functionality\nto be added to any static website with little more than adding a snippet of code to\nthe site.</p>\n<h3 id=\"conclusion\"><a href=\"#conclusion\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>There are many e-commerce solutions available and the ideal solution will depend on a business' requirements\nand budget.</p>\n<p>We continue to promote a headless approach to developing e-commerce websites and\nwould welcome a no-obligation chat about what solution would be the best fit.</p>\n<p>If you would like to discuss your e-commerce project please do <a href=\"/contact/\">get in touch</a>.</p>\n","image":"https://images.pexels.com/photos/50987/money-card-business-credit-card-50987.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=2&h=750&w=1260","imageAlt":"Static Website Online Shop","path":"/blog/can-an-ecommerce-site-be-static/","team":{"name":"Forbes Gray","twitter":"@4beez","path":"/meet-the-team/forbes-gray/","links":["https://uk.linkedin.com/in/forbesgray","https://twitter.com/4beez"]},"date":"1 February 2022 02:30"}},"context":{}}
